National Volunteer Week was established in 1974 to recognize the lasting impact of volunteer service on our communities, local and global. As a leader in volunteer programs for more than 50 years, ACDI/VOCA is proud to celebrate the achievements and dedication of the more than 12,000 volunteers we have mobilized around the world.



Today, we highlight Daniel Flaherty, winner of the 2020 Farmer-to-Farmer Volunteer of the Year Award for his outreach efforts to spread the word about the Farmer-to-Farmer Program. A livestock farmer from Catskills, New York, Daniel has served on several volunteer assignments in the Kyrgyz Republic, where he helped the Veterinary Department of Jalal-Abad State University improve its management and strengthen its course curriculum in veterinary science. Upon his return home, Daniel not only shared his experiences within his professional community but also facilitated a donation of 10 microscopes to Kyrgyz students from a U.S. university. 



Watch a video tribute to Daniel from the Farmer-to-Farmer 35th Anniversary event, held on December 8, 2020, to see his powerful personal testimony about the importance of volunteer service. The full virtual celebration is accessible here.
